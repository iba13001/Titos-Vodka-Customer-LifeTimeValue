## Overview
- The competition and the opportunities for Tito's Vodka are analyzed.
- The project provides a customer segmentation using Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) segmentation.
-  Marketing plans and Market Basket Analysis for each segment are proposed.
- A probabilistic predictive model is proposed to predict the Customer Lifetime Value.

## Conclusions
- US Vodka is the most sold liquor category; there is a lot of competition and opportunity.
- US Vodka is sold for a fairly cheap price as compared to other popular categories.
- Marketing campaigns and promotions to be intensified in February, May and October.
- Low value stores are out of the marketing analysis; they are likely out of business.
- Medium value stores are very competitive with Hawkeye Vodka.
- Titoâ€™s is winning in the high value stores (wholesale/club stores)
- BG/NBD model predicts the alive probability with an accuracy of 94.8% and a risk of 5.2%
- RFM segmentation and Customer Lifetime Value Prediction are together beneficial to plan and to evaluate marketing campaigns.
